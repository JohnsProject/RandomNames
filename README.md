# RandomNames
A command line app that generates random names based on tags.

## USAGE
``
Use 'NameSize' argument to set character count of name (like 'NameSize10')
``

``
Use 'NamesCount' argument to set the number of names to generate(like 'NamesCount10')
``

The name generator will generate names based on tags, so you need to feed the algorithm with some tags, to do so just write the tags as arguments ``like java NameGenerator house car bike``
